Telescope Innovations Frontend Test
===================================

For this test you will need to read a JSON file with tabular data and show it in a table and a graph.
You may use any Javascript libraries or frameworks you prefer for your solution. This test is designed to
be completed inside of an hour, which will be taken into account when evaluating your solution. Don't be
worried if you don't have enough time to build something polished, but please do prioritize your time where
you feel it is needed.

Notes
-----

- Run `npm run start` to start a basic webserver to serve the files in `public/`
- The JSON data should be available at `http://localhost:8080/data.json`
- The data you are displaying is a simulated reaction with components `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` and `cat` (a catalyst)
- You may ignore the `index` column, this was added during the JSON export
- Feel free to reach out if you need clarification on anything
